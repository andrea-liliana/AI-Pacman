# Comments on the code

## Type hinting

We did not used type hinting in the file `bayesfilter.py` to keep the
coherence.

We used it `a_star.py` and `pacmanagent.py` to enable more features of our text editor (Visual Studio).

## Pep8

To check the Pep8 conpliance, we used an online tool:
"http://pep8online.com/checkresult"


The given code may have been changed to respect pep8 conventions. Only spaced, or line fragmentation where used, nothing else was touched.
