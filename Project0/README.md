## Description

An intelligent agent was implemented based on search algorithms for maximizing the score.

The code can be run using the following commands:

```bash
python run.py --agentfile dfs.py --layout medium
```
The following algorithms were implemented:
1. Depth-first search
2. Breadth-first search
3. Uniform-cost search
4. A-star

The programming projects are adapted from [CS188 (UC Berkeley)](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).
